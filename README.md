# The News Room Challenge:

- We were challenged with replicating a given website in a certain amount of time. The applications purpose was to send a request to an api and provide the user with the top 10 series at the time of the request.


## Dev:

- Connor Roelofsen.

## Project Links:

- [User](https://github.com/grconnor/viaplay_exam)

## Built with

React v.16.13.1 </br>
**Testing framework:** Cypress

## Getting started

### Dependencies

- Yarn
- React
- Cypress

### Necessary steps:

```
$ yarn install
```

### Start Cypress for integration testing:

```
$ yarn cy:open
```

### Compile and deploy the application locally:

```
$ yarn start:silent
```

### User Stories

```
As a User
In order to know the top 10 series,
I would like to see the 10 series displayed.
```

```
As a series api
In order for the user to see the series,
I would like to provide a list of the top 10 series.
```

### Examples:

The API is located at:

```
https://content.viaplay.se/pc-se/serier/samtliga
```

The presented UI looks like this:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `yarn start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

## Learn More
